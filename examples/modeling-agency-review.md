# Contract Review: Northvane Model Management — Model Representation Agreement

**Document Type:** Modeling Agency Representation Agreement
**Your Position:** Model / Talent
**Counterparty:** Northvane Model Management, LLC
**Risk Level:** 🔴 High
**Document Status:** Draft

## ⚠️ Pre-Signing Alerts

- **Blank field:** Commission rate in Section 3.1 references "the rate set forth in Schedule A" — Schedule A not attached
- **Missing exhibit:** Schedule A (rate schedule) referenced throughout but absent

---

## Executive Summary

One-sided agency agreement with significant model risk. The 3-year exclusive term,
uncapped physical appearance control, "in perpetuity" digital image rights, and
missing payment timeline create serious exposure. The upfront "comp card fee" is
an immediate red flag. Do not sign without substantial negotiation.

## Risk Analysis

### 🔴 Critical

**Upfront Comp Card Fee** (Section 5.1)
> "Model agrees to pay Northvane Model Management a comp card production fee of $350 upon signing"

- **Issue:** Legitimate agencies earn revenue only when models book paid work — upfront fees of any kind are a scam indicator
- **Risk:** $350 paid before any work is booked; agency has zero incentive to perform
- **Industry Standard:** $0 upfront — period
- **Market:** NY Labor Law Art. 11 prohibits advance fees by licensed talent agencies in New York
- **Redline:** Delete Section 5.1 entirely
- **Fallback:** If agency insists, require that the fee is recoupable against first booking within 90 days

---

**"In Perpetuity" Image & Likeness Rights** (Section 6.2)
> "Model grants agency and its clients a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to use Model's image, likeness, name, and voice in perpetuity across all media now known or hereafter developed"

- **Issue:** Your face can be used forever, in any medium (including AI training), globally, with no compensation beyond the original shoot fee
- **Risk:** Images could appear in advertising campaigns years after the relationship ends, including AI-generated content using your likeness
- **Market Standard:** Per-project license with defined duration (1-2 years) and specific media/geography
- **Redline:** Replace "in perpetuity" with "for a period of [2] years from the date of the applicable shoot" and add "excluding use in AI training datasets or generative AI applications"
- **Fallback:** Cap at 5 years with right of approval for re-use beyond initial campaign

---

**Physical Appearance Control** (Section 8.3)
> "Agency may require Model to modify appearance including but not limited to hair color, hair length, weight, and grooming at Agency's reasonable discretion to meet client requirements"

- **Issue:** Agency can alter your hair, require weight changes, and control grooming without your consent — these are changes to your body
- **Risk:** No consent requirement, no limits on requests, no compensation for complying
- **Market Standard:** Appearance requirements should require model's written consent for each change; model retains final say over body modifications
- **Redline:** Add: "All appearance modifications require Model's prior written consent. Model's refusal to consent to any modification shall not constitute grounds for termination."
- **Fallback:** Add a consent requirement with a defined list of modifications that are pre-approved vs. those requiring case-by-case approval

---

### 🟡 Important

**Commission Rate + Service Charges** (Section 3.1)
> "Agency commission is 22% of gross booking fee, plus applicable service charges as defined in Schedule A"

- **Issue:** 22% already exceeds the industry standard of 15-20%; Schedule A (which defines service charges) is missing
- **Risk:** True commission rate unknown — could be 22% + 5-10% in additional fees, for an effective rate of 27-32%
- **Market Standard:** 15-20% all-in; no separate service charge layer
- **Redline:** Fix rate at 20% inclusive of all charges; attach and cap Schedule A; add "no additional charges apply"

---

**Auto-Renewal with 30-Day Notice** (Section 2.2)
> "Agreement auto-renews for successive one-year periods unless either party provides written notice 30 days prior to expiration"

- **Issue:** For a 3-year agreement, 30 days is very tight — easy to miss and be locked in for another year
- **Market Standard:** 90 days notice for agreements of this length
- **Redline:** Change "30 days" to "90 days"

---

**No Payment Timeline** (Section 7.1)
> "Agency shall remit payment to Model within a reasonable time following receipt of client payment"

- **Issue:** "Reasonable time" is legally undefined — agency can hold earnings for months
- **Market Standard:** Net 30-60 from date agency receives client payment, with itemized statement of deductions
- **Redline:** Replace with: "Agency shall remit payment to Model within 30 days of receiving client payment, accompanied by an itemized accounting of all deductions"

---

**Early Exit Penalty** (Section 11.2)
> "In the event of early termination by Model, Model shall forfeit commissions equivalent to 6 months of average monthly bookings based on the prior 12 months"

- **Issue:** Heavy financial penalty for leaving a bad relationship — models can be trapped even if the agency stops performing
- **Market Standard:** No penalty for termination with proper notice; at most nominal forfeiture of pending booked commissions
- **Redline:** Delete Section 11.2; add: "Either party may terminate this agreement with 60 days written notice without penalty"

### 🟢 Reviewed & Acceptable

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Governing Law | ✓ | New York — regulated state with talent agency licensing requirements |
| Confidentiality | ✓ | Standard mutual NDA provisions |
| Non-Disparagement | ✓ | Mutual, reasonable |
| Indemnification | ✓ | Mutual, not uncapped |

---

## Missing Provisions

| Provision | Priority | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Expense Deduction Cap | Critical | Without a cap, agency can deduct travel, digitals, shipping with no limit |
| Direct Booking Rights | Critical | Unclear if model can book direct clients without agency commission |
| Portfolio Ownership | Important | Who owns photos from test shoots the agency arranges? |
| Performance Obligations | Important | What does agency promise to do? If they stop pitching you, what's the remedy? |
| AI/Deepfake Exclusion | Important | No protection against use of likeness in AI training or generated content |

**Suggested Expense Deduction language:**
> "Agency may deduct actual, documented expenses from Model's earnings only with prior written approval for each expense exceeding $50. Total deductions shall not exceed 5% of gross booking fees in any calendar month."

**Suggested Performance Obligation language:**
> "Agency agrees to actively pursue bookings on Model's behalf and shall submit Model for a minimum of [X] opportunities per month. Failure to meet this obligation for two consecutive months constitutes grounds for termination by Model without penalty."

---

## Internal Consistency Issues

- ⚠️ Section 3.1 references Schedule A (rate schedule) — not attached
- ⚠️ Section 6.2 says "non-exclusive" but Section 4.1 grants exclusive representation — these conflict

---

## Negotiation Priority

| # | Issue | Ask | Negotiability |
|---|-------|-----|---------------|
| 1 | Delete upfront comp card fee | Remove entirely | High — NY law may already prohibit it |
| 2 | Physical appearance clause | Add consent requirement | High — reasonable ask |
| 3 | Image rights duration | Cap at 2 years per project | High |
| 4 | Commission rate | 20% all-in, no service charges | Medium |
| 5 | Payment timeline | Net 30 with itemized statement | High |
| 6 | Early exit penalty | Remove; replace with 60-day notice | Medium |
| 7 | Auto-renewal notice | 90 days | High |

---

## Model-Specific Protections to Request

1. **Performance clause**: If agency doesn't book you within 90 days, you can exit without penalty
2. **AI exclusion**: Explicit prohibition on using likeness for AI training or generative content
3. **Category carve-out**: Retain right to book direct for categories the agency does not actively represent you in (e.g., if they only do runway, carve out commercial work)
4. **Expense approval**: Written approval required for any deduction from earnings
5. **Accounting statements**: Monthly statements showing gross bookings, commissions, deductions, and net paid

## Common Modeling Contract Red Flags Summary

1. **Any upfront fee** — legitimate agencies earn only when you book paid work
2. **Commission above 25%** — 15-20% is the industry standard; stacked fees inflate the real rate
3. **"In perpetuity" image rights** — your face used forever with no recourse
4. **Unconsented appearance control** — agency requiring body or appearance changes without your approval
5. **Missing Schedule A** — signing without seeing the fee schedule you agreed to
6. **No payment timeline** — "reasonable time" means they can hold your money indefinitely
7. **Heavy exit penalty** — financial trap that keeps you stuck even with a non-performing agency
